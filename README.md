# SGD in Gaussian Processes

## Introduction

* In this project, we apply stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm and its variants to accelerate and improve Gaussian process (GP) inference.
* We provide code for implementing **sgGP** described in *Stochastic Gradient Descent in Correlated Settings: A Study on Gaussian Processes* by Hao Chen, Lili Zheng, Raed Al Kontar, Garvesh, Raskutti.
